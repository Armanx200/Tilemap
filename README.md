# Tilemap
This Python script implements a simple tilemap generator using the Tilemap class. The code divides a 2D map into four parts (top, bottom, left, and right) to create a seamless tile-based environment. Each part of the map is represented by instances of the Tilemap class, allowing for dynamic map creation and modification. The script includes methods to set the initial map, handle neighboring maps, and print the resulting composite map.

Key Features:

- Tilemap class for managing tile-based maps.
- Dynamic handling of top, bottom, left, and right parts of the map.
- Methods for setting and fixing the map to ensure continuity.
- Example usage with an initial tilemap configuration.
